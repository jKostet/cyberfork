TKO-Ã„ly Tournament Game Jam 2017

Cyberfork is a quick action filled arena game where two teams struggle to deliver a bomb into the other teams factory. Players control robot truck lifts capable of lifting and moving different things around. Destructible crates and traps may be placed as defences and in order to hinder enemy advances into your factory. There is a race against time as leaving the bomb in the middle ground will annihilate both teams in the blast.
